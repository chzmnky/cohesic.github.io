										<h2 class="major">HOW CAN WE USE PATIENT DATA TO IMPROVE CLINICAL DECISIONS?</h2>
										<p>
												Today's healthcare system is complex.  Institutional information systems are rapidly being challenged by expanding demands to support and manage medical diagnostic and patient-health data. Cohesic is focused on bridging the expanding gap between legacy system capacity and future need for the delivery of data-driven, individualized patient care.
										</p>
										<p>
												At Cohesic, we are changing the way data is generated and used in healthcare. Through intuitive cloud-based applications, we are creating a cohesive system for the capture and meaningful use of data in patient care.  Our software allows diagnostic test providers to increase efficiency and data quality, referring physicians to make data-supported decisions, and patients to engage in their care.
