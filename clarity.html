									<h3 class="major">Empower patients through their data</h3>
									<p>Patients and physicians share a common desire to access information that helps improve care decisions, provide reassurance, and develop trust.  Clarity® is an intuitive mobile app, designed first and foremost for patients to engage in their care. Used with or without <a href="acuity.html">Acuity®</a>, this app captures relevant and repeated measures of patient health while asking questions that may trigger appropriate changes in care.  Patients voluntarily provide standardized updates for their care team over our secure network, appearing as priority-ranked notifications.  These appear on the clinic App that is used routinely to check-in patients and obtain similar health status assessments prior to each office visit.  At the clinic, this App is integrated with the hospital information system to reduce workload for clinic staff and maintain documentation compliance.  Overall, this provides a fully integrated longitudinal record of patient-reported health from clinic to home.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Connect patients and care providers</h3>
									<p>Automated and secure linkage between Clarity® and Acuity® allows physicians to access diagnostic test results and view these along-side patient health measures all within the same tablet-based App.  They can take advantage of intuitive and patient-friendly graphical summaries of test results to describe care decisions in the clinic and transfer these summaries to the patient’s App to take home.  Patients can then provide permission to registered health professionals to view their health data, such as family physicians, emergency or on-call physicians.  This is all accomplished within a secure, HIPAA compliant cloud-based architecture managed by a sophisticated Patient Information Data Service (PIDS®).  PIDS® ensures that patient identifiers can only be associated with our cloud-hosted anonymous data while within a secure institutional network.</p>
